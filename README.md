# SolHelp
A collection of resources for game creation using different engines.

Yo!

So, this is a collection of my external modules for use to assist with game development using game engines.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solarlune), by e-mail at (solarlune(at)gmail.com), or on the individual forums / communication sites for the engines that this collection will serve. Currently serving:

 * The [Blender Game Engine](http://blender.org) (the BGE folder)
 * [BDX](https://github.com/goranm/bdx) (the BDX folder)

[(AFAIK) The Largest Blender Game Engine Forum](http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?12-Game-Engine-Support-and-Discussion)

[BDX Sub-reddit for discussion and support](http://www.reddit.com/r/bdx)

You can copy and paste the text from the source files, but it's a lot simpler to just pull the code using Git with a client like [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).

If you get fed up with this and want to return to the old modules I made, you should be able to use an SVN tool on the old repositories at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/solarlune-game/). You should be able to use older revision numbers to grab the code from the timeframe you desire. Easy-peasy.

Thanks a lot for following me on this road of coding. I appreciate it! Well, I hope you find my modules useful, and have fun!
