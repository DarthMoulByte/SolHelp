A collection of resources for game creation using different engines.

Yo!

So, this is a collection of my external modules for use to assist with game development using game engines.

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solarlune), by e-mail at (solarlune(at)gmail.com), or on the [BDX subreddit for discussion and support](http://www.reddit.com/r/bdx)

You can copy and paste the text from the source files, but it's a lot simpler to simply grab the .jar from the release list. You can also pull the sources to integrate into your project by using a GIT client pointed to this repo.

The old collections of these modules can be found on the old, archived repositories at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/solarlune-game/). You should be able to use older revision numbers to grab the code from the timeframe you desire. Easy-peasy.
