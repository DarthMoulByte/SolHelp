A collection of resources for game creation using different engines.

Yo!

So, this is a collection of my external modules for use to assist with game development using game engines.

Feel free to contact me on [https://twitter.com/solarlune Twitter], by e-mail at (solarlune(at)gmail.com), or on the individual forums for the engines that this collection will serve. Currently serving:

 * The Blender Game Engine (the BGE folder)
 * The [https://github.com/goranm/bdx BDX Game Engine] (the BDX folder)

[http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?12-Game-Engine-Support-and-Discussion Largest (AFAIK) Blender Game Engine Forum]

You can copy and paste the text from the source files, but it's a lot simpler to just pull the code using Git with a client like [https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ TortoiseGit].

If you get fed up with this and want to return to the old modules I made, you should be able to use an SVN tool on the old repositories at [code.google.com/p/solarlune-game Google Code]. You should be able to use older revision numbers to grab the code from the timeframe you desire. Easy-peasy.

Thanks a lot for following me on this road of coding. I appreciate it! Well, I hope you find my modules useful, and have fun!
